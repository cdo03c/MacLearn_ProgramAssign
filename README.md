Please look at the html file associated with the PMLProject.Rmd

This repository contains a Rmd file, html file, and README for the Practical Machine Learning course project through Coursera and Johns Hopkins University.


The PMLproject.Rmd script downloads a training and test data set collected from a series of accelerometers used to quantify how well a barbell lift is performed. 

More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

The run_analysis.R script creates a tidy training, testing, and validation data set consisting of 53 variables including the quality variable labled "classe".


Notes: 
======
- The PMLProject.Rmd script takes a few minutes to run because it was written with effectiveness and not efficiency in mind.
